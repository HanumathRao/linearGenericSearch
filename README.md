# linearGenericSearch
Implementing a linear search on already sorted items (either ascending or descending).

To run the program please give the following commands

make (creates a smokes_test exe in target folder)

make debug(creates a smokes_testd exe in target folder)

make clean(cleans the compilation artifacts in the target folder)

This program implements following functionality.
/* Search an array of sorted numbers.
*
* items    : An array of sorted ints, with no duplicates
* n_items  : Number of elements in the items array
* ascending: non-zero if the array is sorted in ascending order
* key      : the key to search for
* type     : the type of match to find
*
* This function finds the element in the array
* that best fits the search criteria. It returns
* the match type and the index of the matching item.
*
* LessThan
* --------
*  Finds the largest item which is less than the key.
*  It returns FoundLess if a match is found, NotFound
*  if no match is found.
*
* LessThanEquals
* --------------
*  Finds the item which is equal to the key, or the
*  largest item which is less than the key. Returns
*  FoundExact if an item that exactly matches the key
*  is found, FoundLess if a non-exact match is found
*  and NotFound if no match is found.
*
* Equals
* ------
*  Finds an item which is equal to the key. Returns
*  FoundExact if an item if found, NotFound otherwise.
*
* GreaterThanEquals
* -----------------
*  Finds the item which is equal to the key, or the
*  smallest item which is greater than the key. Returns
*  FoundExact if an item that exactly matches the key
*  is found, FoundGreater if a non-exact match is found
*  and NotFound if no match is found.
*
* GreaterThan
* -----------
*  Finds the smallest item which is greater than the
*  key. Returns FoundGreater if a match if found, NotFound
*  if no match is found.
*
* Examples
* --------
*  Given the input array [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] (ascending order)
*
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  | Key | Type              | Returns      | Index |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  | -1  | LessThanEquals    | NotFound     | X     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  0  | LessThan          | NotFound     | X     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  0  | Equals            | FoundExact   | 0     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  1  | Equals            | NotFound     | X     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  2  | GreaterThanEquals | FoundExact   | 1     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  2  | GreaterThan       | FoundGreater | 2     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*
*  Given the input array [8, 6, 4, 2, 0] (descending order)
*
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  | Key | Type              | Returns      | Index |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  | -1  | LessThan          | NotFound     | X     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  4  | LessThanEquals    | FoundExact   | 2     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  8  | Equals            | FoundExact   | 0     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  5  | GreaterThanEquals | FoundGreater | 1     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  2  | GreaterThanEquals | FoundExact   | 3     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*  |  9  | GreaterThan       | NotFound     | X     |
*  +-----+-------------------+--------------+-------+
*
* Assumptions
* -----------
*  The items are sorted
*  Items will be non-NULL
*  There are no duplicate items
*  n_items will be > 0
